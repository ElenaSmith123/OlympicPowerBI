#The video recording of Olympic project
#Data Source: Kaggle.com
#Animation: downloaded play bar

#About dataset: orginal dataset has 94 rows, and I keep 13 as the sample for the project. 
#About Power BI canvas: 5 graphs in total. The left three are the histogram of the number of golden, silver and bronze medals of each contry, while the map in the right presents the shape of each country. The play bar at the right down corner is the downloaded automation bar, and the bar is the independent axis of all other four graphs in the canvas, which makes all graphs change or highlight based on the changing of the bar.
